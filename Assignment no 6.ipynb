    "### Question No 1\n",
    "#### ANSWER:\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs which is using the idea of \"objects\" to represent data and methods. Usually, computer programs were just a list of instructions to the computer, telling the computer to do certain things in a certain way, which is called procedural programming. However, in object-oriented programming, computer programs make use of objects that talk to one another and to change the data in those objects, to work in a way that the user wants. Also, because of the way object-oriented programming is designed, it helps the developer by allowing for code to be easily reused by other parts of the program or even by other people."

    "#### ANSWER:\n",
    "###### CLASS: A class is an entity that determines how an object will behave and what the object will contain. In other words, it is a blueprint or a set of instruction to build a specific type of object.\n",
    "###### OBJECT:An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful.\n",
    "###### BEHAVIOUR:The behavior of an object is defined by its methods.Methods determine what type of functionality a class has, how it modifies its data, and its overall behavior.\n",
    "###### STATE:The states of object are the instances inside the object that contains the data."
